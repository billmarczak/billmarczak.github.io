      <h4 id="about"><b>ABOUT</b></h4>
      <p>I am
      a <a href="https://citizenlab.org/category/author/bill-marczak/">Senior
      Research Fellow at Citizen Lab</a>, a co-founder
      of <a href="https://bahrainwatch.org/">Bahrain Watch</a>, and a
      Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Berkeley, where
      I <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2016/EECS-2016-213.html">received
      my PhD in Computer Science</a>.  My work focuses on novel
      technological threats to Internet freedom, including new
      censorship and surveillance tools.  My expertise is in Internet
      scanning and conducting digital investigations.  Coverage of my
      work has been featured

      <h4 id="hits"><b>GREATEST HITS</b></h4>
      <p><b>2016-2017: Exposing Government Hacking of Mobile
      Phones</b><br/> I discovered
      the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/how-bill-marczak-spyware-can-control-the-iphone">first-ever
      iPhone zero-day remote jailbreak</a> seen in-the-wild (the
      Trident), sold exclusively to governments by Israeli
      cyber-warfare company NSO Group, and used to infect targets with
      spyware (Pegasus) through links in SMS text messages.  In 2016,
      the spyware
      was <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/">used
      against UAE dissident Ahmed Mansoor</a>.  In 2017, Citizen Lab
      colleague John Scott-Railton and I discovered that Mexican
      activists, journalists, and
      politicians <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/">had
      also been targeted</a> with NSO's Trident and Pegasus.  The
      findings sparked a scandal,
      <b>#GobiernoEsp√≠a</b>, in Mexico.</p><br/>

      <p><b>2016: Documenting a Targeted Internet Access Disruption</b><br/> In June 2016,
      traditional Internet measurement techniques failed to establish
      evidence of reported Internet disruptions targeted at protest
      areas in the Bahraini village of Duraz.  In response, I
      <a href="https://bahrainwatch.org/blog/2016/08/03/bahrain-internet-curfew/">performed
      a measurement study</a> and provided the first-ever technical
      evidence for
      a <a href="https://apnews.com/a241133829184283a958c784c2add616/report-internet-disruption-bahrain-rally-site-deliberate">deliberate</a>
      small-scale landline and mobile Internet disruption.  The study
      involved comparing signaling messages received from cell towers
      in Duraz both before and during the disruption, and remotely
      scanning Bahrain's Internet space for landline connections
      exhibiting abnormal packet loss.</p><br/>

      <p><b>2015: Discovering a Nation-State DDoS
      Infrastructure</b><br/> In 2015, together with my Berkeley
      colleague Nick Weaver, I discovered
      the <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/"><b>Great
      Cannon</b></a>, an attack tool that hijacks users' connections to
      Chinese websites and enlists their computers in DDoS attacks
      against websites.  The Great Cannon was employed
      in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/technology/china-is-said-to-use-powerful-new-weapon-to-censor-internet.html">massive
      DDoS attacks</a> against pages on Amazon and GitHub providing
      access to political content banned in China.  We found that the
      Great Cannon is collocated with China's Great Firewall,
      suggesting government attribution.  Subsequent reporting
      confirmed that the Great Cannon
      was <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1764378/chinas-great-cannon-programme-has-been-development-about-year-sources-say">developed
      by</a> the Chinese Government.</p><br/>

      <p><b>2013-2014: Blocking Bahrain's Deadly Tear Gas</b><br/> In
      the wake
      of <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/reports/weaponizing-tear-gas.html">revalations</a>
      that Bahrain's Ministry of Interior had killed dozens of
      residents of predominantly anti-government villages by firing
      tear gas projectiles directly at their bodies, or into their
      homes as they slept, I designed and helped lead a successful
      international campaign
      that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ab675920-76ea-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0">blocked
      a shipment</a> of 3 million tear gas canisters from South Korea
      to Bahrain.
      The <a href="https://bahrainwatch.org/stoptheshipment/"><b>#StopTheShipment</b>
      campaign</a> involved
      the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/805315-bahrain-tear-gas-tender.html">first-ever
      leaked documents</a> from the Bahrain Ministry of Interior's
      Purchasing Directorate, as well as collaborations with lawyers,
      activists, journalists, and South Korean NGOs.</p>
